This is my setup for my laptop. Everything seems to be working although cannot boot straight from EFI partition on M.2 Getting error AAPL: #[EB|LOG:EXITBS:START] and nothing on Dortania's Troubleshooting guide seems to work. If you find something that works please let me know.

Working:
*iMessage
*Facetime
*Wifi (using Airportitlwm)
Bluetooth mouse (using the Microsoft Scultp Comfort) unsure about other bluetooth devices)
Airplay to Samsung 8 series TV
Audio speakers builtin
Microphone
sleep (although sometimes wifi wont come back on it's own, must turn off wifi and turn back on)

What is not working:
Battery indicator (dont know how to make this work)
Maps
